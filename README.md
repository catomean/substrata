# Substrata

Open-source research on the physical chokepoints between here and a
technological singularity.

Live at **https://substrata.orangecat.ch** — that is an address, not an
affiliation. Substrata is its own firm, its own repository and its own
deployment, the same as every other site in the studio. The subdomain is used
because that apex domain is already owned; it moves to its own domain the day
one is bought, and nothing in this repository changes when it does.

## Shape

```
config/     the research corpus and the site, as data — the SSOT
            substrata.ts               identity, mandate, phases, disclosure
            substrata-coverage.ts      15 chokepoint materials, 92 producer rows
            substrata-participants.ts  102 organisations across 10 chain layers
            substrata-acting.ts        thesis, action routes, readiness ledger
            site-substrata.ts          those objects, rendered as pages
            site-content.ts            the closed set of section shapes
components/ the renderers. Presentational only; they never fetch.
app/        one catch-all route. Pages are data, so adding one is a config entry.
app/globals.css   every design token, and the only place a colour is defined.
```

Nothing on the site is authored twice: the mandate, the coverage universe and
the directory exist once, and the pages are those objects rendered.

Every producer row starts unsourced and renders as "unverified lead", never as
a finding. There is no trading desk and nothing here implies one.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run verify     # type-check + lint + tests
```

## Deployment

Push to `main`. CD is the shared self-host pipeline
(`maonakamoto/fleetcrown/.github/workflows/selfhost-deploy.yml`), which waits
for this commit's CI, builds, rsyncs to bitbaum and health-checks before
declaring done. Port and hostname come from `scripts/hetzner/apps.conf` in
fleetcrown — the SSOT for what runs on the box.
