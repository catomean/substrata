/**
 * The one test this site needs: its entire content validates against the
 * shared schema it is rendered with.
 *
 * This is the extraction's contract running in reverse — substrata is
 * sitekit's reference consumer, so a schema change that would break this site
 * fails HERE, in this repo's CI, before it ships to any generated site. It
 * also replaces a `jest --passWithNoTests` that had never actually run: jest
 * was never a dependency of this repo, so `verify`'s test gate was a no-op on
 * every fresh install.
